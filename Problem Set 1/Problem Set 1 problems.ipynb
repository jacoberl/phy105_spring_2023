The _Riesz representation theorem_ guarantees that each element of the dual space can be respresented by an element of the Hilbert space, which acts on other elements by the inner product , i.e. $\\forall g\\in H^*,\\:\\exists f\\in H\\:{\\rm s.t.}\\:\\forall h\\in H,\\: g(h) = \\langle f, h\\rangle$.
